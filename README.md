Creating a Number Game in Java, where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game includes several features to enhance user experience:

Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within the specified range (1 to 100) for the user to guess.
User Input: The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the program validates the input to ensure it is a number within the allowed range.
Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Attempt Limitation: The user has a limited number of attempts (10) to guess the correct number, adding a challenge to the game.
Multiple Rounds: After each round, the user is given the option to play again, allowing for multiple rounds of play.
Scoring System: The program keeps track of the user's score based on the number of rounds played and the number of successful guesses, providing a sense of achievement.
Overall, this task combines elements of randomness, user interaction, and basic game mechanics to create an engaging and fun experience for the player.
